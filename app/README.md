# Story Telling App

## Overview
The **Story Telling App** is a dynamic web application where users can create and manage custom characters, which are then used to generate engaging stories. The app leverages AI models to craft stories based on user-defined characters, giving each one a unique role and personality in the narrative.

## Features
- **Character Management**: Create, edit, and delete characters with attributes such as name, description, and personality.
- **Custom Story Generation**: Use AI to generate stories incorporating the characters created by users.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from different AI models (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5) for story generation, allowing comparison of output quality.
- **Live Streaming Output**: Stories are streamed in real-time as they are generated by the model.
- **Story Summary**: A summary of each characterâ€™s role in the generated story is provided at the end.
- **Dynamic Model Evaluation**: Experiment with various context window sizes and models to see how well they "remember" characters.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js**: For building the web interface and server-side API.
- **React**: For creating interactive UI components.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety and improving code reliability.
- **OpenAI API**: To power the AI-based story generation.
- **Tailwind CSS** (optional): For a clean, responsive design.
